Companies love to ask questions on data structures and algorithms, problem solving, critical thinking, past experience, and the expectations of the internship/job. With these resources we guarantee that you will be better prepared for whatever challenges that may lie ahead in your career.</h1> <h1><u>Books</u></h1> <div class=\"col s12 m7\"><h4 class=\"header\">Introduction to Algorithms</h4><div class=\"card horizontal\"><div class=\"card-image\"><img src=\"images/icons/CLRS.jpeg\" height=\"400px\" width=\"320px\"></div><div class=\"card-stacked\"><div class=\"card-content\"><p>Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p></div>  <div class=\"card-action\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now on Amazon</a></div></div></div></div>        <div class=\"col s12 m7\"><h4 class=\"header\">Cracking the Coding Interview</h4><div class=\"card horizontal\"><div class=\"card-image\"><img src=\"images/icons/CTCI.jpg\" height=\"400px\" ></div><div class=\"card-stacked\"><div class=\"card-content\"><p>Cracking the Coding Interview gives you the interview preparation you need to get the top software developer jobs.

This is a pity, because the techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge: • Techniques – Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack. • Resources – Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task, they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application. This book is intended as a manual on algorithm design, providing access to combinatorial algorithm technology for both students and computer professionals. </p></div><div class=\"card-action\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693\" target=\"_blank\"c>Buy it now on Amazon</a></div></div></div></div> <h1><u>Online Resources</u></h1>                                                                        <div class=\"col s12 m7\"><h4 class=\"header\">Google Interview University</h4><div class=\"card horizontal\"><div class=\"card-stacked\"><div class=\"card-content\"><p>This is a multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to Google software engineer.

The submissions with the most positive votes appear on the front page or the top of a category. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called \"subreddits\". The subreddit topics include news, science, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing, among many others.
