Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p></div>  <div class=\"card-action\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now on Amazon</a></div></div></div></div>        <div class=\"col s12 m7\"><h2 class=\"header\">Crack the Coding Interview</h2><div class=\"card horizontal\"><div class=\"card-image\"><img src=\"images/icons/CTCI.jpg\"></div><div class=\"card-stacked\"><div class=\"card-content\"><p>Cracking the Coding Interview gives you the interview preparation you need to get the top software developer jobs.
